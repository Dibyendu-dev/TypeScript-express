# TypeScript Practice Project

This is a simple Node.js and TypeScript-based project that demonstrates the use of Express.js for building APIs. The project is structured to include versioned API routes, environment configuration, and basic request handling.

## Features

- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses `dotenv` to manage environment variables.
- **Versioned API Routes**: Organized API routes for version 1 (`/api/v1`) and version 2 (`/api/v2`).
- **Ping and Health Endpoints**: Basic endpoints to check server health and connectivity.
